## Overview

This repository contains a basic implementation of an ERC20 token contract named "Manucoin" with the symbol "MNC." The contract allows minting, burning, and transferring of tokens. It is developed using Solidity and is designed to demonstrate the core functionalities of an ERC20 token.

## Features

- **Minting Coins:** The ability to create new tokens and assign them to an address.
- **Burning Coins:** The ability to destroy tokens from a specific address.
- **Transferring Coins:** The ability to transfer tokens from one address to another.

## Getting Started

To use or deploy this contract, you'll need the following:

- **Solidity Compiler:** Version ^0.8.25
- **Remix IDE or any Ethereum development environment** (e.g., Hardhat, Truffle)
- **MetaMask** or any other Ethereum wallet for interacting with the contract.

## Deployment

1. Deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain using a suitable Ethereum development environment like Remix or Truffle.
2. Once deployed, the contract owner can interact with the contract to mint new tokens, transfer tokens to other addresses, and burn tokens.
